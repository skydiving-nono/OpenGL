This is a hub for basically the source code from a beautiful WikiBook simply titled "OpenGL Programming."

The article can be found at: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming
The source code, provided by the authors can be found at: https://gitorious.org/wikibooks-opengl/modern-tutorials/source/0b75884b849e8144899b72097d48f7f034c6d4e4:
