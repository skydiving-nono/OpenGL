I am learning OpenGL and creating an implementation of Depth of Field in the realm of 3D graphics.
I will be working mostly to be have a main implementation completed by May, 2014. As I learn and create, I want to help whoever comes behind me and their life to be easier by being able to see how I learned OpenGL.
