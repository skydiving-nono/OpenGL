I am learning OpenGL and creating an implementation of Depth of Field in the realm of 3D graphics.
I will be working mostly to be have a main implementation completed by May, 2014. As I learn and create, I want to help whoever comes behind me and his/her life to be easier by being able to see how I learned OpenGL.

Notes:
In most OpenGL programs, most of the time we will be depending on three sources to pull from.
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)
In programming we have primitive data types. These sort of form the building blocks of making more complex code. In OpenGL we have geometric primitives.
GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN

GLUT/freeglut
 -created by Mark Kilgard
 -GLUT handles the tasks like creating a window on a screen, change the size of the window, allow mouse input, etc.
 -while GLUT still exists, freeglut is a more up to date version of GLUT

GLEW (openGL Extension Wrangler library)
-"The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform." -glew.sourceforge.net
