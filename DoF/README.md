## Course Notes

This project was initiated for a course Applied Computer Graphics, CSC 4357. Visit the course website 
[here](http://csc.lsu.edu/~kooima/csc4357/index.html)

## Developer Notes

**5/10/14** In order to see desired effects of DoF effect, the application must be run, exited, and run again. The first run creates the image, the second displays this run.
